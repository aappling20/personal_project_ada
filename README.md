Personal Project 1:PlantMatch(work in progress title) – An Interactive Plant Recommendation & Care Website
Project Description:

PlantMatch is a creative, user-centered website where users take an interactive quiz to find plants that best match their lifestyle, experience level, and preferences. The site is designed for everyone from beginner plant owners to advanced plant enthusiasts. Based on quiz responses, users will receive multiple plant matches along with detailed care guides for each recommendation.

What I hope to get out of this project: 
Showcase UI/UX design skills through a cohesive, user-friendly website
Gain experience translating design concepts into functional code
Improve frontend development and interactive design skills
Build a strong portfolio piece aligned with personal interests
